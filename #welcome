   Welcome! Welcome to our Discord server, The Lonely Nights! Where the lone moon stays up in the night!

   Ok so, first question you might asked after receiving that enthusiastic welcome message: What is this place? Simply put, it's the place where anyone can gather and talk their interest with others - Anyone, anywhere - may that they're from Asia and you're from Europe or so. Simple. But, is that all? No, of course not. Because we can stretch it even further. From just being a hub for everyone everywhere, a battleground of power, a warzone of clans, to a plave where you can promote your Youtube or Twitch channel or the likes, even ads...
   But, how does that works?
