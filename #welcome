   Welcome! Welcome to our Discord server, The Lonely Nights! Where the lone moon stays up in the night!

[What is this place?]
   Ok so, first question you might asked after receiving that enthusiastic welcome message: What is this place? Simply put, it's the place where anyone can gather and talk their interest with others - Anyone, anywhere - may that you're From Europe and they're from Asia, or so, because we're all here just to gather on the cozy campfire, covered by the everlasting nights, and away from its coldness. Simple. But, is that all? No, of course not. Because we can stretch it even further. From just being a hub for everyone everywhere, a battleground of power, a warzone of clans, even to the place where you can promote your Youtube or Twitch channel or the likes, and then ads, tournament, and quest. Near or far, it's all depends on you...
   But, how does that works? How can you promote yourself here, or wage a war? Well, to answer that, you need to know about all the basics:

1) Leveling System.
2) Rewards System.
3) 9-Tier Roles.

   Coming soon; not enough members:
4) Clan Sytem 
5) Tournament
6) Quest
7) ...
