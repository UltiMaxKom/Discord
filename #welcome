        Simply put. The Lonely Night is a dimension where anyone, anywhere, anytime, of any race, be that a Dragon or a Dwarf, from any timeline, any univer- you get the idea -to gather around the Campfire of Warmth and to interact with each other whether that directly, or by sharing through a specific topic on its intended thread. That is, TNL is essentially a general hub for everyone. A hubworld for anyone to rest before starting their respective adventure on the real world, or even after the adventure has already ended.
        
        But of course, by putting a literal Archdemon in mission to destroy all lifeforms and an Elf that keeps world peace in the same room we need an order of authority. That's why there's roles and moderation. Each person will have a role. Be that a simple citizen sharing interesting stuff, to a helper and leader. Everyone is a hero in their own story, unique, but still act like a gear of a whole. Nothing will end up in vain, so don't stop spinning, or else the world will stop moving in motions.
